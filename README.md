# Typ's Simple Notification System
A simple notification system I created in like 5 min for my friend, I'm going to be improving this for a while.

use this loadstring:                       
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChloDev/My-Simple-Notification-Gui/main/Notification%20System.lua"))()
```
to make a notification do:                             
```
MakeNotification("Name","Text",DurationInSeconds)                                                                  
MakeStyle2Notification("Title","Text",DurationInSeconds)
```
