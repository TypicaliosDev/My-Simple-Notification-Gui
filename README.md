# Typ's Simple Notification System
A simple notification system I created in like 5 min for my friends gui so they didn't have to use the roblox one, I'm going to be improving this for a while.

use it by adding the thing below to the top of ur script
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypicaliosDev/My-Simple-Notification-Gui/main/Notification%20System.lua"))()
to make a notification do 
MakeNotification("Name","Text",DurationInSeconds)
MakeStyle2Notification("Title","Text",DurationInSeconds)
